                "description": "Employees remain the most essential stakeholder group for achieving organizational goals. How an organization benefits from their knowledge and experience is a well-known topic in human resource management. Empirical research findings confirm two key factors here: employees engage if they experience corporate culture (aspect in C1) as appropriate, and if they participate in actual co-decision making. Initially, co-decision making is implemented at the direct work level of an employee in C4.  The expansion of co-decision making to the strategic level of an organization has long been recognized as an essential pre-condition to understand an organization's purpose and its attitude towards innovation by employees. Without understanding of the purpose and participation of employees, implementation of any necessary changes will be more difficult.The extent to which other stakeholder groups should be involved in strategic decisions depends on the purpose of the company or organization and the support provided. However, dependencies that could be detrimental to organizational development should be observed carefully and be avoided. This aspect should be given particular attention in organizations where co-ownership is excluded by law, or by unalterable legal statutory articles of an association. It should be absolutely clear that, depending on the initial situation, the joint development of the organization is pursued continuously and with thorough attention to stakeholders. This applies in particular to the careful handling of data and know-how, the understanding of contexts and their consequences, and the development of justified trust.",

The distribution of ownership interests aims to secure the autonomy and sovereignty of a company or organization, and helps it operate independently of individual interests. An interest in maintaining and developing the company's aims and social purpose is the prerequisite for a share in ownership. The long-term goal is that those who work in the company would hold a majority of voting rights. Involved are entrepreneurs, executives, and all other employees. For co-entrepreneurs two roles are considered. They are part of the employees as they work for the company or organization, and in their role as owners they assume the business risks of their invested capital.

At the team level, employees make decisions independently and extensively, without direction from the top but in close collaboration with all organisational stakeholders concerned of decisions. On all other levels, employees have the possibility to co-determine the organisation in a bottom-up principle. Co-determination also means collective responsibility. The right of employees to co-determine organisational decisions is based on a willingness to actively seek and learn information to make informed decisions. To this end the organisation creates conditions to enable employees to make informed decisions and supports its employees. Employee co-determination is not about all decisions. It is about always maintaining the right balance between co-determination, operational efficiency, and  effectiveness.",

The design phase of products and services is fundamental to reduce or eradicate environmental impacts related to usage and end-of-life treatment. The categorization of environmental impacts as either fixed or variable impacts is used to discern if impacts are reported and evaluated in D3 or in E3. Variable impacts that are only incurred when customers use the service, are to be reported in D3. Fixed impacts that are incurred even if the service is not actively used, are reported under E3.

Ultimately, this is the only effective way to reduce environmental impacts at a societal level. Reducing consumption requires organizations to re-think their activities more profoundly than improving efficiency and circularity. Reducing consumption runs contrary to the prevailing growth paradigm.

Sufficiency can be included in business models using sufficiency concepts, for example reduction, abstention, substitution, re-sizing, sharing, de-materializing (digitalisation), multi-purposing, or other ways to reduce resource and energy consumption.

Products and services should be necessary for a simple and satisfactory way of life that is physically and mentally healthy. Products and services that directly contribute to the Common Good are produced in a socially responsible manner that is environmentally sustainable. In addition, ECG organizations offer solutions to some of the greatest challenges societies face, for example, overcoming poverty, providing high quality nutrition, education, and health for all people, and addressing social inequality. In the initial section of the handbook on Purpose the organization focuses on its reasons for existence and being in business. These permeate all matrix themes, both at the level of internal processes, at the level of the relationship with all stakeholders and at the level of products and services. In E1 the focus is on products and services. More specifically, E1.1 explores how products and services of the organization satisfy human needs and respond to \"glocal\" (global and local) challenges. In E1.2 concrete impact indicators of core business activities of the organization are reported, in order to measure the organisation's effectiveness in bringing the desired positive change. Therefore, E1.2 has to do with the impact of the implementation of the purpose through products, services and core business activities, whereas the introduction section on Purpose has a focus on reporting the deeper sense of the organization for all the themes and aspects of the matrix.",

                "description": "Inappropriate non-payment of tax refers to all legal and illegal practices whereby a organization makes no contribution, or an inadequate one (through tax and social contribution paid), to the countries and societies in which they operate. Major international companies can use a wide range of practices to take advantage of the fiscal differences in different countries to minimise their tax burden. The tax they pay can therefore be significantly lower than that of small and medium sized companies in the countries where they operate.  This negative aspect therefore only applies to large companies that operate in the international market. It should be noted, however, that there are also risks associated with international online trade and the digital economy. Any activities that entail a legitimate reduction in tax paid are not taken into account (appropriate tax advice should be taken with regard to this).",

A transparent organization provides comprehensive insight in its activities to relevant societal stakeholders. It systematically acquires new insights from different perspectives, provides complete and neutral information, actively seeks exchange of arguments and scrutinizes criticisms. Democratic decision-making and governance ensure that individuals and interest groups are involved in creating the environment we all share.  To engage in democratic decision-making, stakeholders need competences, resources and accessible possibilities to deliver their opinion. Democracy education fosters the capacities of stakeholders to form an opinion, come to informed choices and engage in decisions of local, regional, or global societal interest.

Educational programs can promote awareness, enhance understanding and appreciation of the concerns of indirect stakeholders, for example children, sentient animals, biodiversity. Awareness of the needs of indirect stakeholders fosters a sense of responsibility for our actions and impacts. Education and training helps to respect the interests of indirectly affected people and living beings, learning about the needs of those who cannot speak for themselves, and the practical implementation of their rights in democratic decision-making processes.

                "description": "Organizations and companies have a responsibility to provide information to society transparently and comprehensively. If an organization deliberately publishes false information about itself, its plans, its understanding of facts, or its mission, it harms society and impedes informed choices and discourse. Harm can be caused by: * deliberate misleading through mis-information, non-disclosure of relevant facts, illegitimate interpretation of facts * biased reporting of risks to the detriment of the public, future generations, and nature * neglect of scientific findings or empirical facts * promotion of stereotypes, resentments, group-based misanthropy, or prejudices   * gather and disseminate information with the aim of manipulation or tailored opinion forming * prevent dissemination or discredit information for strategic reasons",
