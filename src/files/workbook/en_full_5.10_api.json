The value manifests itself as a mutual and unselfish willingness to help in times of need, to overcome difficult situations, and to willingly co-operate with one another. It may also entail specific community-based obligations and liabilities, when the collective assumes responsibility for under represented groupings and those with no voice. Solidarity is based on a feeling of togetherness and community. From the ECG point of view, solidarity means an attachment to all people, rather than engagement with a defined group(s). Social Justice aims to achieve a fair distribution of goods, resources, power, opportunities, and obligations. The value is accomplished through social mechanisms, such as a suitable organisation of society, economy, and the state, to ensure equal access to opportunities.

The organization has to consider and disclose the Life Cycle of its main products and services deciding which environmental aspects are relevant by taking into account their ability to control and\/or influence them. This does not require a detailed life cycle assessment. A thorough consideration of the life cycle stages that can be controlled or\/and influenced (ISO 14001 \/ EMAS) is sufficient, or of those stages where the environmental impact is significant. To ensure that energy consumption and resource use in manufacturing and transportation, as well as reprocessing, does not have a disproportionate environmental impact, a detailed assessment should be taken in the design of products in particular. This requires a risk assessment and a description of the impact in the above-mentioned stages of the life cycle. As a reference, the impact categories described in E3 can be used. Some services are also associated with high environmental impacts, either through energy consumption and transport, and\/or in the supply chain. In many cases, relevant ecological areas can be reduced to measures in a few hot spots that leverage significant sustainability improvements. The description of the life cycle of products and services is the basis for an assessment of impacts for all stakeholders in different aspects that affect the environment.

This theme is based on the understanding of a company, an organization, as a community of those who work for it, govern it, and as such, create it. Specifically, it is about co-decision making on issues arising from the responsibility of ownership. Ownership is the legal assignability of goods to a natural or legally nominated person as the bearer of rights and obligations. Private owners remain liable in principle, even if there is no equity left. Shareholders have their own rights and limited liability. There are two concepts relevant for an ECG organization: co-determination (B4.1) and shared ownership (B4.2). Co-decision in topic B4 concerns ownership decisions, that means co-determination is achieved by involving stakeholders (e.g. employees) in strategy decisions of the organization. Shared ownership is a goal that has consequences for the legal form of an organization and must be viewed in the regional context of the country where it is vested. Corporate law is not international law, even within the EU, national legislation is not completely harmonised. Applicable legislation may vary in their requirements for transparency, co-determination, responsibilities, and shareholder entitlements. An ECG organization, within the limits of its legal form, strives to establish shared ownership or changes its legal form eventually. An ECG organization, independently of its legal form, actively encourages and facilitates co-determination through suitable decision processes. In corporate forms or organizations that are not privately owned, management bodies and administrative roles are entrusted by law and\/or by statute with above named decisions. The legal requirements for organisations applying to a specific legal form of organization, are country-specific and may differ significantly internationally. Whoever is entrusted with decision making as outlined above, according to a countries' corporate law and legal framework, should be reported. If no natural persons have ownership of a company, the above should be applied to the inclusion and participation of other stakeholders for this purpose. However, this scenario should be described with reasons for this type of ownership structure. In principle, ownership of a company entitles people to make decisions about: * the business model (what is the business purpose and how it is achieved and pursued). * the definition of guiding values for the relations with all contact groups. * the long-term security of the company, including the admission of new participants. * the rules and policies for the use of generated funds."},"description":{"shortName":"B4.description","content":"An ECG organization...\r\n* Enables participation in decisions through the best possible transparency about entrepreneurial activity, strategy, planned goals, concrete sources for decision-making, and expected consequences of decisions. \r\n* In matters of co-determination, it goes far beyond legal rights and anchors additional agreements in statutes and company agreements with legal relevance.\r\n* Continually develops joint decision-making processes as a learning organisation.\r\n* Prepares relevant stakeholders specifically for the acquisition of co-ownership."},"initQuestions":{"shortName":"B4.initQuestions","content":"Initial questions\r\n* What is a good description of our community in our company?\r\n* What is the significance of our legal form, statutes, and decision-making processes for employee engagement? \r\n* What forms of co-entrepreneurship are conceivable for our company?"}},"ecgReportComment":"","ecgAuditReportComment":"","additionalInformationUrl":"https:\/\/example.com\/link\/to\/additional\/information","aspects":[{"type":"aspect","label":"4.1","shortName":"B4.1","name":"B4.1 Transparency and co-decision-making","introductionTheme":{"introduction":{"shortName":"B4.1.intro","content":"Employees remain the most essential stakeholder group for achieving organizational goals. How an organization benefits from their knowledge and experience is a well-known topic in human resource management. Empirical research findings confirm two key factors here: employees engage if they experience corporate culture (aspect in C1) as appropriate, and if they participate in actual co-decision making. Initially, co-decision making is implemented at the direct work level of an employee in C4. The expansion of co-decision making to the strategic level of an organization has long been recognized as an essential pre-condition to understand an organization's purpose and its attitude towards innovation by employees. Without understanding of the purpose and participation of employees, implementation of any necessary changes will be more difficult.The extent to which other stakeholder groups should be involved in strategic decisions depends on the purpose of the company or organization and the support provided. However, dependencies that could be detrimental to organizational development should be observed carefully and be avoided. This aspect should be given particular attention in organizations where co-ownership is excluded by law, or by unalterable legal statutory articles of an association. It should be absolutely clear that, depending on the initial situation, the joint development of the organization is pursued continuously and with thorough attention to stakeholders.

According to the level of evaluation the higher the voluntary payments in relation to mandatory payments are, the higher the evaluation level. The monetary value of the national statutory levies is reported in the organization's yearly tax declaration, e.g. most recent tax declarations or tax expectations of the organization.\r\n\r\nSocial security contributions as defined by OECD are compulsory payments paid to general government that confer entitlement to receive a (contingent) future social benefit. They include: unemployment insurance benefits and supplements, accident, injury and sickness benefits, old-age, disability and survivors' pensions, family allowances, reimbursements for medical and hospital expenses or provision of hospital or medical services. Contributions may be levied on both employees and employers. Such payments are usually earmarked to finance social benefits and are often paid to those institutions of general government that provide such benefits. Total taxes paid are payments mandatory in the organization's country, e.g. corporate and capital income taxes, taxes on labour income, taxes on consumption. \r\n\r\nThe more an organisation deploys its core competencies and productive resources (land, labour, capital and knowledge), and the less it gains in doing so, the higher their **voluntary contributions** can be evaluated.\r\nIn addition to the contributions made, the **social effect** (the 'social footprint') of these measures should be taken into account.

If an organization deliberately publishes false information about itself, its plans, its understanding of facts, or its mission, it harms society and impedes informed choices and discourse. Harm can be caused by: * deliberate misleading through mis-information, non-disclosure of relevant facts, illegitimate interpretation of facts * biased reporting of risks to the detriment of the public, future generations, and nature * neglect of scientific findings or empirical facts * promotion of stereotypes, resentments, group-based misanthropy, or prejudices * gather and disseminate
